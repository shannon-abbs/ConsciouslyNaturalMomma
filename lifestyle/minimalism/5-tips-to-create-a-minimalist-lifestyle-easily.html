              5 Powerful Tips to Create a Minimalist Lifestyle Today. EASILY!
            </h1>

            <p>
              You may have seen the minimalist aesthetic or for home or office
              decor around the web. Minimalism started with art and in fashion
              comes and goes over the decades. Using minimalism in the home is a
              great way to keep your space tidy. However, creating a minimalist
              lifestyle overall can allow you peace of mind in all areas of
              life, not just possessions and style.
            </p>
            <p>
              The truth is, you can incorporate minimalism into your entire
              lifestyle pretty quickly and easily. If you need some order and
              peace of mind in your life then keep reading!

            <h3>How do I know?</h3>
            <p>
              Well, I used to have a walk in closet I called "The hurricane".
              Yeah, clothes just all wound up all over the floor, nothing
              matched, I never knew what to wear. My home was just a cluttered
              mess of crates full of art supplies, or very terrible "decor". And
              by that I mean, literal garbage hanging on the walls. Who even was
              I?!
            </p>
            <p>
              My finances? Ha! Where do I begin? I used mainly cash then and had
              a bunch of random pre-paid cards I'd have to refill at the cashier
              in grocery stores. And my phone was always prepaid, even my rent
              was month-to-month. There's nothing wrong with that, I was
              definitely one of those "F the system!" types. But, nothing was
              simple, streamlined and all the extra added more stress and chaos
              to my life.
            </p>
            <p>
              Fast, forward to when I became pregnant with W. I was ready to be
              a lot more structured and organized. I was about to have a real
              baby after all. It was time to overhaul my entire lifestyle.
              Minimalism fit the bill.

            <h2>Enter, minimalism.</h2>
            <p>
              Now, a minimalist lifestyle doesn't have to be difficult to
              achieve and it's different for everyone. One of the hardest things
              I think most people have a hard time with is where do we even
              start. So, let me give you some pointers on how you can start
              today and make it easy!
            </p>

              <li>2. What does Minimalism Mean to You?</li>
              <li>3. Create a Plan. Start Small. Make it Realistic.</li>
              <li>4. Execute & Be Ruthless!</li>
              <li>5. Keep it Up! This is Who You Are Now.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Decide. What areas of your life need the most help?</h2>
            <p>
              You're here aren't you? You're curious on how to develop a
              minimalist lifestyle for yourself. Are you down with making life
              simpler and maybe a little desperate to get your shit together?
            </p>
            <p>
              Congrats to the first step. So, what areas of your life are you
              willing to simplify? You can apply a simpler minimalist lifestyle
              to any area of your life, really. All you have to do is really
              decide it's time.
            </p>
            <p>
              Are you overwhelmed by everything, everyone and all the noise?
              Really reflect on this. Write down all the things that seem
              chaotic and head on down to the next pointer.

            <h2>What does Minimalism Mean to You?</h2>
            <p>
              Here's the thing. Minimalism is different to everyone. Spend some
              time figuring out what parts of this lifestyle really matter to
              you.
            </p>
            <p>
              A lot of minimalist people love the aesthetic of a clean, calm
              environment. Or just less to look at and take care of.
              <em>(That was me.)</em>
              Some call themselves "extreme" minimalists where they only have a
              backpack or a small place full of absolute essentials.
            </p>
            <p>
              Maybe it's the environmental and sustainable aspect of just
              owning, buying and producing less. The ease of minimal obligations
              may be big on the list! You may even just want a more uniform or
              streamlined flow.
            </p>
            <p>
              Do you want to try it out for a bit, just to clean out a space or
              do you want minimalism to be a part of you and your lifestyle for
              the long-haul?
            </p>
            <p>Having your "why" will help you stick to your convictions.</p>

            <h2>Create a Plan. Start Small. Make it Realistic.</h2>
            <p>
              You know what areas of you life need minimalism and why you're
              doing this. Now's the time to create the plan. You don't have to
              put a ton of pressure on yourself by deciding the whole house and
              everything else needs a renovation with minimalism right now.
              That's a lot at once.
            </p>
            <p>
              It's simple, once you start in one area of your life, naturally
              you'll feel lighter and want to incorporate your new minimalist
              outlook into other areas.
            </p>
            <p>
              All you need to remember is, less is more, everything needs to
              have a place, a purpose, is necessary now and not broken, ugly and
              do you even like it? And there is no "just in case" with stuff or
              clothing, only money. If you're not using it now and don't at
              least once a day/week, or month. Then, do you need it? Nah.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Example:</strong> If you're ready to clear out your closet
              because it's a hurricane like mine was. Then, you can go in with
              the idea that less clothing is going to give you more time in the
              morning to decide. Each item needs to have a hanger and a place it
              always goes back to. The trousers have a purpose and can be worn
              with multiple tops. And the kicker is, you actually enjoy wearing
              them. If a garment doesn't fit into those categories, then it's
              going into the "maybe for a <em>real</em> occasion" pile or the
              donation pile. It's that simple. We also don't do "just in case"
              or "dream body" with clothing. There is hardly ever a time when
              you're going to even touch that item.
            </p>
            <p>
              When attributing to finances you have to be realistic. I mean we'd
              all love to just not have to pay the bills but we also need some
              of those services. The mortgage, utilities and business related
              expenses? Food? Yeah we <em>need</em> those things.
            </p>
            <p>
              <em>Wants</em> on the other hand can be minimized. Do you really
              need <em>all</em> the subscriptions at once? Cut one. Or seven.
              You may be able to combine credit cards or loans into one payment
              instead of five. You may even be able to downsize your home or
              vehicle.

              Yeah, I threw the exclamation point on that one!
              <br />
              <strong><u>Ruthless</u>!!!</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              You decided life needed a minimalistic touch and you identified
              why and where so, now's the time to just do it and not hold back.
            </p>
            <p>
              People's advice is often to put things in a box and store it away.
              If you don't open the box for the item(s) within a certain time
              period then it's time to go. Usually around 3 months or so. It may
              work for some people but for me, I didn't understand the point. I
              already decided the thing needs to go in the box. Then I was just
              staring at this box of <em>stuff</em> with al it's sad dead to me
              energy. Ahem, or I might be tempted to peak inside out of
              curiosity.
            </p>
            <p>Not necessary.</p>

            <p>
              If you truly do not need, use or want something then it's time to
              let it go. You can do this with stuff, people, services, lifestyle
              habits and more.
            </p>
            <p>
              Holding on to things (like the literal garbage I thought was
              <em>decor</em>) only clouds your energy. You gotta keep attending
              to, looking at, clean it and shuffle it around.
            </p>
            <p>
              Ridding yourself of excess is a way to truly change your
              surroundings, you mind and your life. Less allows you to have
              more, peace, time, freedom and calm.
            </p>
            <p>
              Ask yourself, "Do I even like or care for this?" If the answer is
              not a definite "YES!" then goodbye. Put it in the bin!
            </p>
            <p>
              Sentimental items are another thing. Maybe you enjoy seeing an
              object and reminding yourself of loved ones or a great adventure
              you went on. Fine & dandy. But sometimes you may want to ask
              yourself "Why am I hanging on to this?".
            </p>
            <h3>How do I do this?</h3>
            <p>
              Every few months I'll de-clutter my space again and do a little
              life audit of what I may have accumulated. I'll put a big ol' box
              right in my walkway and toss whatever I no longer need in there.
            </p>
            <p>And I do not look back.</p>
            <p>
              It's in the way so I have to trip over it until I get so
              frustrated that it goes on the curb or to donation center. If I
              store it away, I forget.
            </p>

              As for the life audit, I'll write out what isn't necessary.
              Outings, social obligations, draining work responsibilities, extra
              things I pay for, and where my bills are at. They all end up on a
              notebook right next to my laptop. In the way so I have to keep
              looking at to remind me to deal with it.

              If I'm wavering on a subscription like the trampoline park for my
              kiddo, not sure if we really use it, then I'll give it one last
              shot to see if it's worth the cost. If so, then make it a point to
              use more. If not, then goodbye.

            <h2>Keep it Up! This is Who You Are Now.</h2>
            <p>
              I'm gonna be honest and let you know that sometimes the not so
              minimalist lifestyle hits the "Ooh shiny!" and might creep back
              in. Or you might just unconsciously acquire things, or say yes to
              something when maybe you shouldn't. Gifts also happen.
            </p>
            <p>
              Sometimes reminding ourselves of our intentions, our "why" allows
              us to reframe and come back to who we want to be. And hey,
              sometimes we might just have to start again and try better next
              time.
            </p>
            <p>
              When you have the chance to pause and reflect on whether or not
              you really need or want something. You gain the opportunity to
              keep your new minimalist lifestyle going.
            </p>
            <p>
              As with anything in life, if this is important to you then you owe
              it to yourself to celebrate your successes in minimalism. And to
              keep going toward the lifestyle you enjoy.
